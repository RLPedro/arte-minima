        <p>Founded by Pedro Sousa Silva in 2011, <span className="bio__title-ensemble">ARTE MINIMA</span> is a project dedicated
            to the interpretation of music from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries,
            with a particular focus on Portuguese music from this period. The
            ensemble’s working methods are based on models taken from academic
            research that seek to harness the Renaissance approach to study and
            musical interpretation and apply these tools to music-making in the 21st
            century. Our interpretative work is conducted directly from original
            source material without the mediation of modern transcriptions, and
            this philological perspective extends to all aspects of performance
            (theory, instruments, tuning, etc.) as part of an ongoing quest for a
            greater comprehension of the musical language of the past.
            Arte Minima’s many concerts include participation at distinguished
            festivals including Festival Internacional de Música in Póvoa de Varzim,
            Temporada Música in São Roque, Festival de Sons in Almada Velha,
            and Música na Primavera in Viseu, almost always with programmes
            featuring Portuguese works from the Renaissance, many of them in
            their first performance in modern times.
            In 2021, the group completed the recording In Splendoribus containing
            15 previously unpublished works associated with the musical activity
            at the cathedrals of Braga and Porto during the 16th century (with
            financial support from DRCN). Between 2022 and 2023 the group will
            produce three new recordings featuring music by Francisco de Santa
            Maria (with financial support from Fundação GDA and realised in
            association with CESEM-UNL) and Vicente Lusitano (with financial
            support from DGArtes).
            The group’s work has support from CESEM-P.Porto, ESMAE-IPP,
            Instituto Politécnico do Porto, PORTIC – Porto Research, Technology
            and Innovation Centre, and DRCN.</p>

      <p>Born in 1974, Pedro Sousa Silva studied the recorder with Pedro Couto Soares
          at Escola Superior de Música de Lisboa (1992-1996), Reine-Marie Verhagen
          at Utrecht Conservatory (1994) and Pedro Memesldorff at Civica Scuola di
          Musica di Milano (1996-2000). After musicology studies at Universidade
          Nova de Lisboa (1999-2000), where he was tutored by Manuel Pedro Ferreira,
          he obtained in 2010 the title of Doctor in Music at Universidade de Aveiro,
          with a thesis that discusses the interaction between practice and theory in
          the performance of renaissance polyphony.
          As a musician, he has an intensive artistic career in the field of renaissance
          and baroque performance, having performed around 200 times, both as a
          recorder player and musical director, in countless venues and early music
          festivals in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany,

          Netherlands and Brazil. He has collaborated with world renowned early-
          music musicians such as Amandine Beyer, Enrico Onofri, Riccardo Minasi, 
          Jill Feldman and Laurence Cummings.
          As a musical director and researcher, Pedro has been focused primarily
          on the rescue and promotion of Portuguese musical heritage from the 16th
          and 17th centuries. With his ensembles A Imagem da Melancolia and Arte
          Minima, Pedro was responsible for the first modern performance or recording
          of works by Pedro de Cristo, Estevão Lopes Morago, Manuel Rodrigues
          Coelho, Pedro da Esperança and Pedro de Araújo, as well as works by many
          anonymous composers (as most works from that period had an anonymous
          attribution).
          Pedro has been a music teacher since 1992, teaching full time at ESMAE,
          where he is currently Coordinator Professor. He was jointly responsible for
          the creation of ESMAE’s Early Music Department in 2005 and responsible
          for the creation of the Post-Graduate Polyphonia course in 2018. Both
          as a recorder teacher and an expert in the performance of renaissance
          polyphony, he has been invited by some of the most prestigious music
          institutions to give lectures and masterclasses (including Schola Cantorum
          Basiliensis, Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien, Joseph
          Haydn Konservatorium, Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel, Norges
          Musikkhøgskole, Akademie für Alte Musik Bremen, Hochschule für Musik
          Trossingen and Universidade Estadual de São Paulo).
          Pedro is also an Integrated Researcher at CESEM, in the Early Music
          Studies group, where he is especially concerned with the dialogue between
          theory and practice in the renaissance.</p>
